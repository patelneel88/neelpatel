Hey, I am Neel, a CS PhD student in the [USC Theory Group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/), where I am very lucky to be advised by [Shaddin Dughmi](http://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~shaddin/) and [David Kempe](http://david-kempe.com). I was very fortunate to work as a Research Intern at Google Research Mountain View during the Summer and Fall of 2024, hosted by [Kshipra Bhawalkar](https://research.google/people/kshiprabhawalkar/?&type=google) in the Market Algorithms Team. Currently, I am a Student Researcher at Google Research hosted by [Renato Leme Peas](https://www.renatoppl.com/) in the OMEGA team.

I am broadly interested in Combinatorial Optimization in the presence of Uncertainty or Incentives, Computational Economics and designing (fast) Dynamic Algorithms for Graph Problems. Recently, I have been very interested in systematic inference time scaling for LLMs/GenAI to improve thinking capabilities and data selection/data mixture optimziation for training large models. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent a wonderful one and a half years at the National University of Singapore as a Research Assistant working on Explainable and Private ML/AI with [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/) and [Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/). Before that, I completed my B.Stat at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
